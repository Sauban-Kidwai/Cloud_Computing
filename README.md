### Company Operation

DataDrive Analytics is a company specializing in data analytics. We provide businesses with advanced tools and insights to make data-driven decisions. Our offerings include custom data analysis, predictive modelling, and real-time data visualization, encouraging companies to optimize their operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth. We also help companies organize their data in our data base which help companies focus on day-to-day operation instead of worrying about their data security and management. Our data analysts are the best and most presentable way for companies to make the right decision when comes to decision making. 

### Justification for Choosing Cloud Over In-House Infrastructure

DataDrive Analytics has chosen to utilize cloud computing infrastructure over traditional in-house solutions for several reasons:

### Scalability

By using cloud computing, companies can get a lower cost compared to owning their own servers. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud. 

### Cost-Effectiveness

Companies don’t have to invest heavily in data centres and servers and not knowing how to use them or knowing the capacity they need. Companies may be overestimating or underestimating their server capacity which may affect the cost. By using AWS cloud service, companies only pay what they consume in computing resources, and only pay for how much they have consumed. 

### Reliability and Uptime

Cloud providers offer strong uptime guarantees and disaster recovery solutions, ensuring our services remain available and reliable for our clients. As cloud computing usually outside from companies’ office. If a natural disaster occurs at the office of the company location, the companies’ data is all preserved in the cloud so they don’t have to worry about any loss of data.

### Focus on operation

With cloud computing, companies don’t have waste money and time knowing how to maintain data centres. Instead, they can focus on day-to-day operation of their business like how to expand or create the next innovative product, allowing them to make a good decision. 

### Security

AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to ensure and harden our infrastructure, including physical operational and software measures. 

### Cloud Services and Functionalities Implemented

DataDrive Analytics utilizes several AWS services to support its operations, each chosen for its specific features and capabilities:

### Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Provides a secure, isolated network that we have defined where we can launch AWS resources safely.  This allow accessing and processing data to be secure with the following data protection regulation between the resources in VPC and the Internet.

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Offers scalable computing capacity in the cloud, making it easier for developers to modify and adjust towards customer liking. We can launch as many virtual servers as we need for different purpose allowing scaling up of the network to be easier. This ensure that we are provide the optimal compute, memory, storage and networking balance for our workloads. 

### Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

make setting up and scale a relational database in the AWS cloud much easier. It provides cost-efficient, reliable capacity for an industry standard relational database and manages common data base administration task. With automated backups ensuring that our customer data will never get lost. 

### AWS Cloud9

A cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows our developers to write, run, and debug code collaboratively from anywhere, enhancing our team's productivity and agility. It combines the rich code editing features of an IDE such as code completion, hitting and step-through debugging with access to a full Linux server for running and storing code. 

### Rough Cost Estimation

Using the AWS Pricing Calculator and considering the scale of operations of DataDrive Analytics, a rough monthly cost estimate for our AWS services is as follows:

- Amazon VPC: Minimal cost for setup, primarily traffic costs estimated at $50 per month.

- Amazon EC2: Depending on the instance type and required capacity, approximately $1,000 per month for high computational tasks.

- Amazon RDS: For a multi-AZ deployment for high availability, approximately $500 per month.

- AWS Cloud9: Standard environment costing about $20 per month.

The total estimated monthly cost for these services comes to approximately $1,570. This estimate assumes moderate to high usage patterns and may vary with changes in computational needs and data usage. 

Conclusion
DataDrive Analytics is at the forefront of the tech industry, delivering state-of-the-art data analytics solutions to businesses. By leveraging AWS cloud services, we ensure that our IT infrastructure is scalable, cost-effective, and reliable. This enables us to provide top-notch analytics solutions to our clients, helping them unlock the full potential of their data and achieve their business objectives.
